# TheLongDungeon-pygame
Rewrite of The Long Dungeon to Pygame.

Some directives:

-The game should be casual to play. You play whenever you just want to explore or things easy. Just like minecraft/starbound/stardew valley

-Farming elements: animal raising, planting.

-Light on survival elements: resource collection (wood chopping, stone digging), non-intrusive hunger system (like caves of qud?) and death shouldn't be a big concern.

-dungeons? possibly having puzzles regarding stepping, z-levels and various other mechanics I implement.  

-Cool shit: z-levels (mountain peaks, cliffs, ravines, caves, high places).

-Most important of all, stepping: Various planets to explore (crystalline worlds, dark worlds, cloud worlds, black hole worlds).
  Which you can explore and take various items back to your homeworld(s). Like exotic animals/seeds/materials/trophies(?)
  Of course, traversing those harsher worlds shouldn't be easy. They should be locked behind a progression system or some smart play?
  You need some protection in a acid world, but not if you're quickly stepping through this world onto the next one (skipping it).
  Planets should have unique mechanics, one that immediately comes to mind is time dilation and black hole worlds.
  Worlds that orbit a black hole should be slower relative to the universe. If you stay an hour in one, you may find your crops withered and animals long dead        when you come back (that obviously should be told BEFORE the player even goes to such a world).
